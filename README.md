* Extract MI Mobiles and Prices:

4 .Use BeautifulSoup to extract the required information from the parsed HTML.
* Iterate over the HTML elements that represent MI mobiles.
* Extract the mobile names and prices from the HTML elements.
* Store the extracted data in a suitable data structure, such as a list or dictionary.
* Handle Pagination:

* Flipkart may have multiple pages for mobile listings.
* Check if there is a "Next" button or pagination element on the page.
* If present, navigate to the next page and repeat the parsing and extraction process.
* Continue this process until all pages are scraped.
* Store the Extracted Data:


5 .Decide on the desired output format for storing the extracted data.
* Options include writing the data to a CSV file, JSON file, or a database.
* Choose the format that suits your needs and write the extracted data accordingly.
* Run the Scraper:

* Write a main function that orchestrates the entire scraping process.
* Call the necessary functions in the appropriate order.
* Execute the main function to start the scraping process.
