## Steps to Extract MI Mobiles and Prices from Flipkart:



# Set Up the Development Environment:

```bash
1 . Install Python on your machine.
* Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
* Install the required libraries: BeautifulSoup and requests.
* Import Libraries:

* Import the necessary libraries: BeautifulSoup and requests.
* These libraries will help us in parsing HTML and making HTTP requests.
* Send a Request to the Flipkart Website:

2. Use the requests library to send an HTTP GET request to the Flipkart mobile section.
* Retrieve the HTML content of the page.
* Parse the HTML Content:

3. Use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content.
* Find the relevant HTML elements that contain information about MI mobiles and their prices.
* Inspect the Flipkart website to identify the appropriate HTML tags and class names for the mobiles and prices.
* Extract MI Mobiles and Prices:

4 .Use BeautifulSoup to extract the required information from the parsed HTML.
* Iterate over the HTML elements that represent MI mobiles.
* Extract the mobile names and prices from the HTML elements.
* Store the extracted data in a suitable data structure, such as a list or dictionary.
* Handle Pagination:

* Flipkart may have multiple pages for mobile listings.
* Check if there is a "Next" button or pagination element on the page.
* If present, navigate to the next page and repeat the parsing and extraction process.
* Continue this process until all pages are scraped.
* Store the Extracted Data:


5 .Decide on the desired output format for storing the extracted data.
* Options include writing the data to a CSV file, JSON file, or a database.
* Choose the format that suits your needs and write the extracted data accordingly.
* Run the Scraper:

* Write a main function that orchestrates the entire scraping process.
* Call the necessary functions in the appropriate order.
* Execute the main function to start the scraping process.
